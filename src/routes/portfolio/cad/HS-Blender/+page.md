    My very first CAD modeling projects in Blender, rediscovered years later from a stage of life where I was obsessed with Lord of the Rings.

# The Road (to CAD modeling) Goes Ever On and On

While clearing out storage on my laptop, I stumbled across my the initial render below. For the record, I didn't even know I had these files, nor did I realize I still had <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> installed on my laptop, so when I stumbled across this first render of Hobbiton from 2019, I went on an adventure to find the rest of my first CAD models.

Above, hobbithole rendered in Eevee, a final project submitted for a highschool elective I took on a whim. Little did I know that my road through 3D modeling was far from over when I submitted my hobbit hole, but what better place to begin a journey? That being said, when I rediscovered this five years later, I realized I'd completely forgotten how to do anything in Blender, and spent probably an hour digging for the rest of my files. In the process, I experimented with rendering using Cycles, seen below.

The other final submission for the elective was to compile the objects from all the lessons in the class. Since none of the sub-components are really impressive enough to warrant their own pages, here they are.
