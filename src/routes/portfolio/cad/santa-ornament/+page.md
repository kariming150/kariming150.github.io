# SantaBear 

Santa bear ornaments for my adorable absolutely cutest nephew done on this 3D printer.
For this project, I used an app on my Samsung Galaxy tablet called <a href="https://nomadsculpt.com/">Nomad Sculpt</a>. I wanted to make an ornament gift for my brother to celebrate my nephew's first christmas etc etc etc
