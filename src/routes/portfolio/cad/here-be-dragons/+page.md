# Toothless Mod 

Modification of a <a href="https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3258780"> thingiverse object </a> by for printing on a Creality-Cr-10 printer. My first attempts to print the original design ended... poorly. Toothless became Eyeless. And clawless. and spikeless. 

I threw the original stl file into <a href="https://nomadsculpt.com/">Nomad Sculpt</a> for some processing to make sure my slicer would recognize all the pieces as one cohesive object, then adjusted a few details to my liking, like his tail, pupils, and claws. Before and after photos are shown below.
